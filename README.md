# evolve-idle-automation
An attempt to write unlockable automations for Evolve Idle, a very slow game, that requires way too much user interaction.

This is a beginners attempt at writing a Firefox extension, and at the same time automation scripts for an idle game. Pray fate does not go against it.

## How to Run in Local Environment
This is a Firefox extension. As such, to install it on Firefox, you have to:
- navigate to [about:debugging](about:debugging)
- click the 'This Firefox' option
- click the 'Load Temporary Add-on' button
- select any file in extension's directory

This will install the extension until the browser is closed.

Alternatively, you can run the extension from the command line using the web-ext tool.
